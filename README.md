# Guess-Game
A guessing game from the book Learn Java - The Easy Way by Bryson Payne

It was used the _Math.random_ function to return a number and then it asks for the user to insert a number.

A while loop turns possible continue the game if the entered number is not the same the random number.
An if-else statement gives the user hints, if the number the user is trying to guess is close or not to the right number.

A do-while loop makes it possible to be played at least once ans also continue the game while the user answer **yes**.
